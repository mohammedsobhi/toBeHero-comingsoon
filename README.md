### The Problem statement
We did our best to fulfil and meet the technical standards of writing a proper problem statement. First we started with a short brief introduction to explain the problem and how we plan on solving it. Second we moved on to explaining the problem itself in depth, Third was the proposal on how we plan to fix that problem, Fourth was The functional and non-functional requirements, Next comes the Target and development environment that defines the tools we will use to make the platform and lastly was the deadlines and methodology used for development.
